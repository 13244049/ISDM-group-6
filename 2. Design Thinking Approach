Ideation using the above, i.e. using Stages 1 and 2 of the design thinking process. 200-300 word reflections and brainstormed ideas; stating any assumptions made.

By analysing the requirements of stakeholders, it was observed that customers wanted to be served within a timely manner. One improvement that could be implemented within the system would be a reminder that would show on the managers screen to notify them that there is a customer that has recently dialed through, but has not yet been served. This can further assist the Automatic Call Distributor as during busy periods, all managers may be occupied and the ACD may not be able to direct the call through to any managers. This notification can pop up on the managerâ€™s screen to notify them when they are already held up in a call, to serve as a reminder that there is a customer waiting to be served. This can allow managers who have just completed their call to attend to the waiting customer right away. Once this call has been attended to, the notification will minimise and will re open when there is another customer waiting to be served.

Another ideation will be assigning the managers into groups based on the type of request the customer has. For example, if customers want to book a travel package, they will be routed to managers in Group A who are more knowledgeable in that field. If customers have enquiries, they will be routed to Group B who are more knowledgeable in answering the customers enquiries, rather than booking travel packages, and so on. This will create a more efficient system and will reduce the queue times when waiting to match a customer with their assigned manager. Additionally, there can be some managers in groups that are knowledgeable in all aspects to improve the efficiency when routing the calls. If all the managers in their respective groups are occupied, then the customer will be re-routed those few managers that have more detailed knowledge in all areas to reduce the queue times, rather than having the customer waiting for the appropriate manager in their specific groups.
