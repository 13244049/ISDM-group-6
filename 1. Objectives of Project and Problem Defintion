<h1>Introduction
The travel company is currently using a CMC to sell holiday packages to customers. The CMC contacts customers via inbound and outbound calls to advertise the holiday packages and will route a manager to a customer if they have enquiries about the offers. The company wants an updated system that will be able to efficiently route managers to serve customers. The proposal of a new system has been acknowledged and a new system has been in development to address the issue of inefficiency in order to be able to serve more customers. The new system will be developed to achieve the companyâ€™s objectives and improve its overall performance to achieve a competitive advantage in the industry. However, the introduction of a new system poses many risks if the system fails, which can internally and externally affect the operation of the company.

<h1>Objectives

The overall objective of this project is to develop and implement an information system that will enhance the call management centre operation and provide a satisfactory experience to both customers and employees. This information system will improve the dynamic call flow control between relationship managers and customers and also match created profiles based on specific characteristics, for example, language proficiencies and age to ensure a higher chance of customer sale and retention. We will need to segment relationship managers based on their expertise and specific knowledge of holiday packages and connect them to interested customers to allow for easy communication regarding their interest. The information system must assist relationship managers with information and guidelines to help them make sales, create accurate up to date profiles and store them in a database for usage. A clear and distinct outbound call system must also be designed to ensure customers have called the right location and keep them on the line.

Thus, the problem statement defined is as follows: The travel company needs an information system that will enhance their in-house call management Centre to assist and allow for precise and more comfortable communication between the relationship manager and the customers to result in customer retention and satisfaction ultimately.

<h1>Stakeholders

The main stakeholders concerning the information system are the relationship managers. They have a significant impact on the system as they will be the leading group to utilise the system and be trained with the knowledge to perform its functions successfully. Executives of the organisation are also stakeholders with high power and high interest as they have a vested business interest in regards to the successfulness of the project and will make the ultimate decision regarding the start and end of the project. Customers and the company itself are stakeholders due to their ability to be heavily impacted by the service. Customers are the main target to satisfy, and in developing the system, we must emphasise with customers to reach our end objectives of customer satisfaction and retention. Additionally, the development team are also considered stakeholders as they are responsible for creation and implementation of the new system. Their duty is to identify the needs of the company, customers and managers to create a solution that satisfies all their requirements.

System dials numbers automatically through a target list generated. Displays to RM details with guidelines and a script.
System creates a TARGET LIST for each RM dependent  on skills and profile.

Inbound calls, customers are segregrated into scores justifed by their likelihood to purchase a product. These are then ordered according to these
scores and are servered sequentially. These scored can be based on repeat customers and post codes etc.
- Customers with scores are directed to RM's skill level and best match accordingly.
